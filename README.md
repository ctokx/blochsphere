# Bloch Sphere Simulator

## Introduction
The Bloch Sphere Simulator is an interactive 3D visualizer designed to help students and enthusiasts understand the state of a qubit in quantum computing. The tool aims to provide a practical, visual way to grasp quantum mechanics concepts through an intuitive graphical interface.

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: View the state of a qubit on a Bloch sphere in three dimensions.
- **Interactive Controls**: Manipulate the qubit state using simple controls to see how it affects the Bloch sphere.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and educators in quantum mechanics or anyone interested in the basics of quantum computing.
